#### Hells Bells ####

The aim of this exercise is to do some in depth practice of additive, FM and AM synthesis. You will be recreating the sound of a bunch of bells using synthesis only.

                                #### I SAID SYNTHESIS ONLY ####
                                    ##### NO SAMPLES #####  
                        *You will get 0 marks for anything using a sample*


1. Run and explore the sketch. Notice how the structure is very similar to iSynthPhone and MPG. Try making a sound start and stop when you press the first button. Now try adding your own callback functions for some of the other buttons.

2. Pick 5 of the bells/alarms and recreate their sound using the synthesis techniques that you have learnt. The bell should sound when you press the corresponding button.

3. At least one of choices must use additive synthesis, and at least one of your bells must use AM or FM synthesis.

4. Each bell is worth 2 marks.
  - You made a reasonable attempt [1 mark]
  - You have thought carefully about how to recreate the sound and demonstrated this in your comments [1 mark]


Some of the bells have only subtly different qualities. Think in a detailed and logical way about what makes them different.

- more or less harmonic ?
- higher or lower frequency range ?
- longer or shorter decay ?

Half the marks are for your comments, so write them carefully inline. Write about the sound of the bell and how you have attempted to recreate it.
